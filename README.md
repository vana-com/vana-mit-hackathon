# Introduction

This is a demo app created as an example of using Vana API. It is the way to get started quickly on the new project using the Next.js environment.


New to git/npm and think it's a poekmon? [Start here](#quick-ish-start)

# Prerequisites

This project requires the following tools:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The JavaScript environment for server-side code.
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - A Node.js package manager used to install dependencies.

# Quick Start 


1. Fork this repo - [Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
2. Clone your fork: `git clone <your_fork_url>`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run app: `npm run dev`
5. View your app at `http://localhost:3000` and start editing `pages/index.js`

ðŸŽ‰ Woah there! Any faster and you would've broken the sound barrier. Spread that knowledge around and help a fellow sloanie out

# Quick-ish Start

New to git? New to node? That's okay -- we are all here to learn. Follow these more in-depth instructions and feel free to ask a sloanie or the vana team for help

## Step 1 - Create a fork


Click `Fork` in the top right of this repo

## Step 5 - Run the app

```
npm run dev
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats!! You've just successfully setup what you'll need for the hackathon

Now you can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The app will become available on `http://localhost:3000`
