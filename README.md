# Introduction

This is a demo app created as an example of using Vana API. It is the way to get started quickly on the new project using the Next.js environment.

# Prerequisites

This project requires the following tools:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The JavaScript environment for server-side code.
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - A Node.js package manager used to install dependencies.

# Quick Start 


1. Fork this repo - [Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
2. Clone your fork: `git clone <your_fork_url>`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run app: `npm run dev`
5. View your app at `http://localhost:3000` and start editing `pages/index.js`

ðŸŽ‰ Woah there! Any faster and you would've broken the sound barrier. Spread that knowledge around and help a fellow sloanie out

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats!! You've just successfully setup what you'll need for the hackathon

Now you can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The app will become available on `http://localhost:3000`

# Ready for the world to see it?
The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app to the internet is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

To deploy the Demo app, you would need to [configure your project](https://vercel.com/new/clone?project-name=vana-portrait-demo&repository-name=vana-portrait-demo&repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvana%2Fvana-portrait-demo).
